# Site SLM.1842
Site associated with [ANC-λD3.191](www.eunaotenhoacessoaolink.com). It's considered to be the entrance of ANC-λD3.191, a seemingly normal cabin, but that is constantly snowing and underneath it, the main nuclear power plant that caused the anomaly can be found. Normal expeditions<span class="super">1</span> could only be performed after the coverup had been properly implemented. The whole ordeal was so strange, I still feel something crawling behind my neck...
